# `fabrishot`
A minimal Fabric port of [mineshot](https://github.com/ata4/mineshot) which supports high resolution screenshots

~~Edited by me to take screenshots in 7680 x 5760 to use in conjunction with [FlexFOV's](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/flex-fov) Advanced > Cubic FOV to make panoramas.~~

Now archived because you can set custom resolutions in the [original mod](https://github.com/ramidzkh/fabrishot)\
~~[CurseForge page for unedited version](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/fabrishot)~~
